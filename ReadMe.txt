In this project I created an object toencode and decode images. But in the proscess I accomplished alot more than just that we learned more about sfml library, we learned to use passedin command line arguments, in addition to learning how to encode and decode images.The program basically takes a .png or a couple other image format's file name, an output filename, and the seed of 1's and 0's. It then uses this information to encode the image, print out both images, and save the encrypted image to the name that you passed it. You can Complile the code with the makefile and use any image file that you want.
